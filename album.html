    <h3>Description of the album</h3>
    <p>A Flower Bookmark (Korean: 꽃갈피; RR: Kkotgalpi) is the first cover extended play by South Korean singer-songwriter IU. It is also her fourth Korean-language extended play. The EP was released on May 16, 2014, the singer's birthday, by LOEN Entertainment under its imprint LOEN Tree. Unlike her previous works, A Flower Bookmark features cover versions of nostalgic K-pop songs popularized from 1980s to 1990s.[1]

        The EP was successful both commercially and critically. It spawned two hit singles; the lead single "My Old Story" and "The Meaning of You". The former topped Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100,[2][A] while the latter was ranked at the top of Gallup Korea's Song of the Year in 2014.[3][B] In particular, the latter has gone to sell more than two million digital copies since release, even outselling the album's lead track. The EP also earned IU a MelOn Music Award for Artist of the Year, and a nomination for Album of the Year[4][5] and was also listed at number three on Billboard's list of "Best K-Pop Albums of 2014".[6]
        
        A limited LP edition, featuring a bonus track "Eoheoya Dunggidunggi", was available for sale.[7] As of June 2022, the album has sold over 50,000 physical copies and six million digital singles in the singer's native country (see Charts).</p>
