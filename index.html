    <p>Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), also known by her stage name IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South Korean singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first mini album Lost and Found (2008). Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은 날), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.[1]

        With the success of her 2011 albums, Real+ and Last Fantasy, IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's "little sister".[2][3] 2011 also saw her first foray into songwriting with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the television series The Greatest Love. IU's third full-length album release, Modern Times (2013), showcased a more mature style that marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 positions on Gaon Digital Chart. The album was ranked number two on Billboard's "25 Greatest K-Pop Albums of the 2010s" list.[4] IU subsequently exerted more creative control over her music; Chat-Shire marked the first time she is credited as the sole lyricist and composer of her own album.[5] While her succeeding extended play and full-length albums continued to deviate from mainstream K-pop styles, exploring and mixing various music genres, IU consistently retained her dominance on music charts in her native country.[6][7][8] IU's fourth studio album, Palette (2017), became her first title to reach number one on Billboard's World Albums chart.[9] Her 2020 single release, "Eight", became her first single to reach number one on the World Digital Song Sales chart.[9]
        
        Aside from her music career, IU has ventured into hosting radio and television shows, as well as acting. Following her supporting role in teen drama Dream High (2011) and minor appearances in several television series, she was cast in leading roles in television drama series You Are the Best! (2013), Pretty Man (2013–14), The Producers (2015) and Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016). IU's role as a desperate office worker in My Mister (2018) earned her critical acclaim and she received her first Best Actress in Television nomination at the 55th Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2019, she starred in anthology film series Persona and fantasy television series Hotel del Luna, the latter of which led to her second Best Actress nomination at the Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2022, IU starred in Hirokazu Kore-eda's Broker, alongside Song Kang-ho, Bae Doona and Gang Dong-won. She is also set to star in Lee Byeong-heon's upcoming film Dream.
        
        IU has released a total of five studio albums and nine extended plays in her career, scoring five number-one albums and thirty number-one singles, making her the artist with most number-one songs in South Korea. As one of the best-selling solo acts in the group-dominated K-pop industry,[10] IU became the first solo female K-pop act to perform at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena during the Seoul leg of her 2019 Love, Poem concert tour.[11] She has been included five times in the top ten of Forbes magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity list since 2012 and reached a peak ranking of number three that year.[12] In 2014, Billboard recognized IU as the all-time leader of its K-pop Hot 100 chart with the most number-one songs and the artist who has held the number-one position for the most weeks.[13] She was named Gallup Korea's Singer of the Year in 2014 and in 2017.[14][15]</p>
